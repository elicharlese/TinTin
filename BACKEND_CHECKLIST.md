# Backend Development Checklist

This checklist is designed to guide the development of a robust, production-ready backend for your application, ensuring all frontend components and business logic are fully supported. The stack includes Next.js (React TS), Supabase, Vercel, and Rust Solana SDK for blockchain integrations. Most backend logic will be in TypeScript, with Rust for Solana-specific features.

---

## 1. Project Setup
- [ ] **Monorepo/Repo Structure**: Organize backend and frontend code for clear separation and maintainability.
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Set up `.env` files for local, staging, and production. Document all required variables.
- [ ] **TypeScript Configuration**: Ensure strict type checking and linting for backend code.
- [ ] **Supabase Project**: Initialize and configure Supabase (auth, database, storage, edge functions).
- [ ] **Rust Toolchain**: Set up Rust toolchain and Solana SDK for blockchain modules.
- [ ] **CI/CD**: Configure GitHub Actions for linting, testing, building, and deploying to Vercel.

---

## 2. API Design & Implementation
- [ ] **REST/GraphQL Endpoints**: Design endpoints for all major resources:
  - Accounts
  - Transactions (CRUD, bulk actions, filtering, sorting)
  - Categories & Tags
  - Budgets & Goals
  - Alerts & Notifications
  - Recurring Transactions
  - Reports & Analytics
  - User Profile & Settings
  - Crypto Assets (with blockchain integration)
- [ ] **API Validation**: Use Zod or similar for request/response validation.
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Standardize error responses and logging.
- [ ] **Rate Limiting & Security**: Implement rate limiting, CORS, and security headers.

---

## 3. Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] **Supabase Auth**: Integrate Supabase Auth for user management (sign up, login, OAuth, password reset).
- [ ] **Session Management**: Securely manage sessions/tokens on both client and server.
- [ ] **Role-Based Access Control**: Enforce permissions for sensitive endpoints (admin, user, etc).

---

## 4. Database Schema & Logic
- [ ] **Schema Design**: Model all entities (users, accounts, transactions, categories, tags, budgets, goals, alerts, crypto assets, etc).
- [ ] **Migrations**: Use Supabase migrations for schema changes.
- [ ] **Indexes & Performance**: Add indexes for frequent queries (e.g., transactions by date, user, category).
- [ ] **Data Validation**: Enforce constraints at the DB level (foreign keys, unique, not null, etc).
- [ ] **Seed Data**: Provide scripts for initial data (for dev/staging).

---

## 5. Blockchain Integration (Rust + Solana)
- [ ] **Rust Solana SDK**: Set up Rust workspace for Solana programs (smart contracts).
- [ ] **Wallet Integration**: Enable wallet connect, balance fetch, and transaction signing from frontend.
- [ ] **On-chain Data**: Implement Solana programs for storing/retrieving relevant data (e.g., crypto asset ownership, transaction proofs).
- [ ] **API Bridge**: Expose TypeScript endpoints that interact with Rust Solana programs (via RPC or custom bridge).
- [ ] **Security Audits**: Review smart contracts for vulnerabilities.

---

## 6. Business Logic & Features
- [ ] **Transactions**: CRUD, bulk delete, filtering, sorting, recurring logic, review status, notes, tags.
- [ ] **Accounts**: CRUD, balance calculation, account types.
- [ ] **Categories/Tags**: Hierarchical categories, tag management, color coding.
- [ ] **Budgets & Goals**: Budget creation, progress tracking, goal setting, alerts for overspending.
- [ ] **Alerts/Notifications**: Real-time notifications for important events (e.g., low balance, new transaction, goal reached).
- [ ] **Reports/Analytics**: Generate summaries, charts, and export data (CSV, PDF).
- [ ] **Crypto Assets**: Sync balances, fetch market data, show staking/yield info, support for DeFi/CeFi assets.
- [ ] **User Profile/Settings**: Manage user info, preferences, theme, notification settings.
- [ ] **Data Import/Export**: Allow users to import/export transactions and settings.

---

## 7. Integration with Frontend
- [ ] **API Contracts**: Ensure all endpoints match frontend expectations (see `components/transactions-list.tsx`, etc).
- [ ] **Real-time Updates**: Use Supabase subscriptions or WebSockets for live data (e.g., new transactions, alerts).
- [ ] **Error & Loading States**: Return clear status for all API calls.
- [ ] **Pagination & Infinite Scroll**: Support for large lists (transactions, reports).

---

## 8. Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: For all backend logic (TypeScript and Rust).
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: End-to-end tests for critical flows (auth, transactions, blockchain ops).
- [ ] **API Tests**: Validate all endpoints (success, error, edge cases).
- [ ] **Load Testing**: Simulate high usage for performance bottlenecks.
- [ ] **Security Testing**: Check for common vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, etc).

---

## 9. Production Readiness
- [ ] **Build Optimization**: Ensure production builds are optimized (tree-shaking, minification, etc).
- [ ] **Monitoring & Logging**: Integrate with Vercel/Supabase monitoring, set up error tracking (e.g., Sentry).
- [ ] **Backups**: Automate database backups.
- [ ] **Documentation**: API docs (OpenAPI/Swagger), onboarding guides, runbooks.
- [ ] **Deployment**: Push to GitHub, auto-deploy to Vercel (main branch), verify production environment.
- [ ] **Rollback Plan**: Have a strategy for quick rollback in case of failed deploys.

---

## 10. Post-Deployment
- [ ] **Smoke Test**: Verify all major features work in production.
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**: Track API latency, error rates, and resource usage.
- [ ] **User Feedback**: Set up channels for bug reports and feature requests.

_This checklist should be updated as the project evolves. Each item should be checked off as it is completed._
